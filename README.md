# 💠 Solidity Language Support for Zed

Enhance your Zed editor with Solidity language support through this extension.

## 🛠️ Development Setup

**1. Clone the repository**:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/zarifpour/zed-solidity
```

**2. Load the extension**:

Move the `zed-solidity` directory to `~/Library/Application Support/Zed/extensions/installed`.

**3. Installation Options:**

- Directly run `make` (ensure Docker is running) within the cloned directory, **OR**
- Manually set up by following these steps:

  1. Navigate to the repository:

     ```shell
     cd zed-solidity
     ```

  2. Clone the `tree-sitter-solidity` repository:

     ```shell
     git clone https://github.com/parmanuxyz/tree-sitter-solidity
     ```

  3. Move into the `tree-sitter-solidity` directory:

     ```shell
     cd tree-sitter-solidity
     ```

  4. Build the WebAssembly (WASM) file (ensure Docker is running):

     ```shell
     tree-sitter build-wasm
     ```

  5. Rename the generated WASM file to `solidity.wasm`.

  6. Relocate the `solidity.wasm` file to the `zed-solidity/grammars` directory within this repository.

> [!Note]
> The extension has been observed to load correctly. However, there is an issue where it fails to recognize Solidity files and does not automatically set the language for these files when the extension is loaded.
